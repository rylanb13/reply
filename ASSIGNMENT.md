# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> One of the most useful parts of reply API was the README file. It was very specific and gave the general description of most of the functionality.
> It also has plenty of examples that I used to actually test the functionality to see how it ran in the command line.
> Honestly I don't think anything could have made it easier in a sense that anything more could have made it more confusing.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> This means to me to create a comment that is concise but to the point. If I had to explain this to a CSE142 student, I would tell them type what the code actually runs. Never explain the code but describe the usage and outcome of running the code.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 6


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Slack, Google


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Accessing slack. I wasn't able to access slack because of account issues, so it took a little longer than I wanted.
